          <p>
            I started to program during my freshmen year in our school at STI
            College Malolos. I always keep on studying how to code, and during
            our IT Projects, I often selected as one of the lead programmers in
            a group for the past four years. C# is our primary programming
            language to develop our Projects. We also used web development like
            HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP, but I didn't focus much on it at
            that time. <br />
            <br />
            During my internship, I got involved in becoming a UI/UX Designer,
            and it took my interest. After the internship, I started to discover
            more of the web development and get my self more involved in it.
            After watching on youtube and Udemy courses, I have decided that
            this is the path that I wanted to pursue, to become a web developer.
            <br />
            <br />
            I will work smarter & harder to pursue my dreams for my family. And
            I will be dedicated to my job and love it to be able to contribute
            to the company.

            I serve as an IT intern at Pierre and Paul Solutions Inc., as I have
            gained valuable insight into the IT industry for over the past three
            months. Because they allowed me to work on a variety of Projects, I
            had the chance to observe numerous aspects in IT industry, from
            designing User Interface & User Experience of a web & mobile
            application, to editing advertisements in photoshop, and to maintain
            computers & network. They were extremely welcoming and helpful and
            offered me a piece of excellent career advice. This internship had
            increased my interest in pursuing a career in the IT Industry.
